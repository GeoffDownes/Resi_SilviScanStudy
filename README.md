# Resi_SilviScanStudy

THis Repo contains the intial text, datat sets and analysis code used in the manuscript submitted to the journal Forests as part of a Special Interest edition "SI: Recent Advances in Nondestructive Evaluation of Wood: In-Forest Wood Quality Assessments" guest edited by Xiping Wang, Research Forest Products Technologist
Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory.

The title of the submitted version is "A comparison of radial wood property variation in Pinus radiata between an IML PD-400 ‘Resi’ instrument and increment cores analysed by SilviScan".

It is part of a larger series of projects aimed at supporting the commercial uptake of the IML Resi technology as part of their routine forest assessment protocols. The projects are largely funded by industry and Forest and Wood Products Australia Limited (https://www.fwpa.com.au/) and build on a decade of prior reserach projects described in the folloiwng links
