The winter cambium bears a closer resemblance to the summer cambium than it does to the winter cambium of any other angiosperm or gymnosperm described in the literature. In particular there is little change in vacuolar structure, endoplasmic reticulum form, and dictyosomal activity during the year. The only changes which take place involve a slight increase in vacuole volume, storage of starch in vacuoles, and a decrease in numbers of spherosomes during the summer. These observations confirm that, while the degree of cambial activity is reduced in the winter, complete dormancy is absent.},

   abstract = {Since 1988, there has been a major focus in Tasmania on research for the management of temperate eucalypt plantations for solid wood. This coincided with the formal transfer of large areas of native forest that had previously been part of the production forest estate into reserves, a decision that triggered the establishment of eucalypt plantations for solid wood. This review summarises research on several key areas: silvicultural requirements for solid-wood production; wood properties of plantation-grown eucalypts and the influence of silviculture and genetics on these properties; factors influencing stem defect and decay; balancing silvicultural requirements with maintenance of tree vigour; and issues concerning wood processing and products. We conclude that there are still operational challenges to be confronted in the production of solid wood from plantations. If these can be overcome in the medium term, temperate plantation eucalypts have the potential to provide wood products that meet the requirements for appearance-grade material and that can compete in the same markets as wood from native forests. The bigger challenge at the national level will be to provide the log volumes of suitable material to meet the anticipated demand 25 to 30 years from now.},

   journal = {Forest Ecology and Management},

   number = {3},
   pages = {173-180},
   abstract = {In a comparison of 27-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don on a nitrogen deficient coastal dune and growing with or without lupin plus fertiliser, mean wood density, earlywood density, and latewood density in individual annual growth rings were significantly lower in treated as compared to control stands. Latewood percentage showed a similar pattern of variation in relation to treatment and tree age when the ring was laid down. Wood density and latewood percentage increased radially from pith to bark, both increasing more rapidly in unfertilised compared to fertilised trees. Mean density, earlywood density, and latewood percentage were significantly related to tree nitrogen status, as reflected by foliar analysis undertaken in the year rings were laid down, and to ring age. Other foliar nutrients tested (P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Mn, Zn, Cu) did not appear to influence wood density when analysed in the presence of N. Wood density was high at this trial site by New Zealand standards, even in fertilised stands, which can be explained at least partly by the low foliar N levels at Woodhill Forest. These exceeded 1.2% only in stands younger than 5 years old. Thereafter, foliar N decreased to ≈1.2% in fertilised stands receiving 100 kg N/ha of fertiliser annually for 10 years, and 0.8% in unfertilised controls. Foliar N levels on recent sands typically fall in the range of 0.9–1.2% at Woodhill Forest, compared to 1.2–>1.5% in most other soil types in NZ. Effective rainfall at Woodhill also tends to be lower than other forest growing areas in New Zealand. At Woodhill, low rainfall during autumn/winter/spring was associated with high latewood percentage and, hence, high ring mean density, while low summer rainfall had the opposite effects.},

   pages = {399-415},
   abstract = {Wood properties vary within stems of trees according to genera, species, and individuals. Such variation is largely systematic and is very pronounced in many pines, notably Pinus radiata and P. taeda. While gradual transitions predominate, there are practical needs for categorizing wood, in cutting stems to log lengths, followed by sorting and segregation for processing. Even radial segregation of wood is often possible. In such pines, there are strong, widely recognized progressions, in various wood properties, from pith to bark. Based largely on variation in density, the first few rings from the pith are widely termed juvenile wood, which intergrades outward into wood termed mature wood. Alternative terminology used for this radial progression has been from corewood into outerwood. Critical examination shows the juvenile versus mature wood terminology to be inadequate, on two counts: (1) various other wood properties, some of which can be important, show substantial axial variation at equal ring number from the pith; (2) this categorization based solely on radial variation does not fit the well-established botanical concept of maturation. However, this axial variation closely parallels the vertical variation in shoot morphology and the onset of reproduction that reflect maturation. This argues for a two-dimensional characterization of wood properties: juvenility versus maturity for the progression up the stem, and corewood versus outerwood for the radial progression from the pith to bark.

   title = {Phazir woodmeal calibration},

   abstract = {The use of hand-held portable near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers such as the Polychromix Phazir™
may provide an affordable method for forest managers to obtain predictive measures of cellulose
content and Kraft pulp yield in standing trees from various types of wood samples. To be useful for
businesses that do not have NIR-related capability in house, the method must give precise
predictions using a simple sampling protocol requiring minimal knowledge of the technology. A
first step is to determine how well the hand-held spectrometer can predict wood properties from the
same types of samples (i.e. woodmeal) that are known to yield successful calibrations for predicting
wood properties using more expensive laboratory NIR instruments.
This report describes the development and testing of a model for predicting pulp yield and cellulose
content in air-dry woodmeal from Eucalyptus nitens from spectra collected using the portable NIR.
The method allowed the samples to be measured without removing them from the plastic bags in
which they were stored. Although developed using E. nitens samples only, the model was able to
predict 80–90% of the variance in samples from two other eucalypt species (E. pellita and
E. globulus), as well as from an independent set of E. nitens samples.
The model is a starting point for the development of a more broadly-based model (representing
more sites and species) that allows industry partners of the CRC for Forestry to gain experience and
confidence in the technology. The model accommodates the chemistry of the plastic bags and
allows the pulp yield and cellulose content of woodmeal to be predicted by the Phazir™ whether
the woodmeal is in the plastic bag or not.},

   institution = {Forest and Wood Products Australia},
   abstract = {A new model of tree growth and xylem formation, which provides explicit predictions of
wood property variation, is presented in this report. The work is the outcome of a three-year
FWPA-funded project with the key objective to: “develop and validate a software tool to
predict variation in commercially important wood properties of Pinus radiata as a function of
variation in growing conditions and management”. This was achieved with the development
of a software tool called e-Cambium that predicts the following variables, at a daily time step,
from basic site, climate and silvicultural inputs:
· Wood density,
· Tracheid cell size and wall thickness
· Microfibril angle (MFA)
· Modulus of elasticity (MOE) and wood stiffness
· Virtually sawn boards of user-prescribed dimensions in terms of number and grade
The model is process-based. It predicts growth and wood properties, effectively simulating
the kind of data that the SilviScan® system generates, by mathematically describing known
and hypothesized processes in tree biology and wood formation. The development of the
code was based on a synthesis of the scientific literature as well as detailed measurements of
tree growth across a six contrasting sites over the 3 year project. Preliminary validation was
against data from previous FWPA studies in which the model performed well. The FWPRDC
Resource for Profit study (2003-2005), provided the relationship between SilviScan data and
actual sawlog out-turn, allowing us to calibrate the virtual sawing simulator. The model is
unique in that it contains the first known process-based attempt to predict MFA, a major
determinant of wood stiffness, in a complete modelling framework. As such, it encapsulates
fundamental biological processes about which there is still much scientific debate.
The project has shown that the 18 key model parameters (which function to limit and restrict
simulations for a particular genotype) can be held constant and describe wood property
variation for very diverse sites and silvicultural regimes. Testing was undertaken across 18
scenarios, from 16 different sites from various radiata growing regions. The model was able
to explain about 80% of the variation in mean core wood density (the average wood density of
a hypothetical sampled core of wood) and 60 – 70% of the variation in outerwood wood
density. Similarly, the model explained 60 – 70% of the variation in mean core and
outerwood MOE. These results show that the model can be expected to be broadly applicable
to P. radiata plantations across quite different regions, grown under a wide variety of
conditions, without the need for re-parameterisation. In this sense it differs from, and is thus
complementary to, empirical models that are easily applied but require regional calibration.
In effect the model encodes decades of knowledge into a predictable form that allows industry
to efficiently utilize this information. Industry workshops were conducted in Hobart,
Melbourne and Mt Gambier where industry representatives from a range of growers and some
processors were given detailed presentations on, and trained in the use of, the industrytestable
version.
Users can explore the effect of age, site and climate variation on predicted sawn product
against which economic values can be readily assigned. Some utilities of a process-based tool
such as e-Cambium are as follows:
· Growing a site “on”: growers can explore the possible growth and wood property
implications and potential of a site into the future
ii
· Exploring the effects of uncertain climate or environmental variation not just on
growth and stand volume, but on properties like wood density and stiffness
· Exploring the effects of altered silvicultural regimes on wood properties like density
or MOE. This is particularly valuable when possible management regimes are
unprecedented
· As a tool complementary to regular sampling or empirical models of growth, wood
density or other wood properties.},

   abstract = {Conventional sampling and laboratory analysis of solid wood properties to facilitate clonal screening in tree improvement programs are prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. Alternative methods—time-of-flight acoustics and micro-drilling resistance—were assessed for efficiency in screening clones for wood stiffness (modulus of elasticity [MOE]), strength (modulus of rupture [MOR]), and density. Ninety clones, consisting of 30 from each of 3 full-sib families, were screened in an 8-year-old loblolly pine (<i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">Pinus taeda</i> L.) field test using a TreeSonic time-of-flight tool and Resistograph drill resistance tool. The same clones were sampled for wood specimens for laboratory tests of MOE, MOR, and density. TreeSonic stress wave speed measurements produced highly repeatable clonal phenotypes that facilitated efficient selection for MOE and to a lesser extent for MOR. Resistograph amplitude measurements had a strong genetic correlation with wood density and facilitated highly efficient selection for density, with correlated responses for MOR and MOE. Combining the indirect traits into a selection index improved gain for mechanical wood traits. Both tools provided high measurement rates that resulted in cost efficiencies. Indirect measurements of solid wood properties should be attractive for clonal selection programs that must screen thousands of clones under a finite budget.},

   abstract = {The mechanism of active stress generation in tension wood is still not fully understood. To characterize the functional interdependency between the G-layer and the secondary cell wall, nanostructural characterization and mechanical tests were performed on native tension wood tissues of poplar (Populus nigra × Populus deltoids) and on tissues in which the G-layer was removed by an enzymatic treatment. In addition to the well-known axial orientation of the cellulose fibrils in the G-layer, it was shown that the microfibril angle of the S2-layer was very large (about 36°). The removal of the G-layer resulted in an axial extension and a tangential contraction of the tissues. The tensile stress–strain curves of native tension wood slices showed a jagged appearance after yield that could not be seen in the enzyme-treated samples. The behaviour of the native tissue was modelled by assuming that cells deform elastically up to a critical strain at which the G-layer slips, causing a drop in stress. The results suggest that tensile stresses in poplar are generated in the living plant by a lateral swelling of the G-layer which forces the surrounding secondary cell wall to contract in the axial direction.},

   abstract = {Abstract We have constructed a novel panel dataset of UK manufacturing firms to examine how innovation, proxied by R&D and intellectual property (IP, covering both patents and trade marks), increases firm performance, as measured by firm net output (value added). Knowledge has public good characteristics of non?depletability and non?excludability. So, even with protection using intellectual property to exclude, imitation and inventing around novel products and processes is possible by competitors. We examine the size and duration of benefits to doing R&D and obtaining IP protection through both patents and trade marks. If non?depletability within the firm is correct, this implies that their absolute R&D effort and total IP assets are important. We examine this hypothesis against the alternative of depletability, where innovative intensity relative to firm size matters. Also if IP offers only weak protection against competition, then the duration of returns to these intangible assets will be short. The empirical results support depletability within firms and poor ability to exclude imitation, which implies that firms have to continually renew their portfolios of R&D?created knowledge and their IP assets to maintain their position in the market. Splitting the sample into industries designated as ?high? and ?low? technology, suggests a higher intensity of competition in high?technology sectors, as an increase in the intensity of patents and trade marks commands no premium in this sector, although persistent differences between firms are positively affected by whether or not firms are acquiring these IP assets.

   journal = {Diversity and Distributions},
   volume = {17},

   abstract = {Aim  This study reports on the contribution of the Australian Tree Seed Centre (ATSC) to the international dissemination of Australian acacias. It also describes the current uses and the scale of economic benefits derived from planting Australian acacias, and speculates about possible future trends in usage. This information is crucial for the evaluation of overall human-mediated transfers of Australian acacias as a global experiment in biogeography. Location  Australia and Global. Methods  ATSC databases were used to determine which taxa were sent to which regions of the world and in what numbers. Location, scale and value of uses of the most important species were described from a review of published and grey literature, and we drew on our collective experience to speculate about future trends. Results  The ATSC despatched samples of 322 taxa (or roughly a third of Acacia species native to Australia) between 1980 and 2010 to 149 countries. Plantations in SE Asia and South Africa supplying the pulp and paper industry cover an area of over 2 M ha and produce pulp worth around $US4.3B p.a. In SE Asia, pulpwood species also provide logs for an expanding industry based on solid wood product. Tannin is produced from Acacia mearnsii in South Africa and Brazil. A suite of multi-purpose species helps meeting the demand for food, fodder, fuelwood, poles and site amelioration in dry zone regions of Africa and elsewhere and are widely incorporated into agro-forestry systems. Acacia saligna is the most widely planted non-timber species with around 600,000 ha established worldwide. Many acacia species also have horticultural uses particularly in Europe. Main conclusions  The ATSC has been the major agent for systematic exploration and worldwide dissemination of Australian acacias over the past 30 years, but seed from local and regional sources of exploited species will dominate future movements. The scale of production from currently planted species will expand to meet the demands of population growth, using improved varieties. Plantations for energy and carbon sequestration might become increasingly widespread.},

   abstract = {Australian acacias are widely planted as exotics and in some cases as invasive. Impact may be reduced if sterile triploid planting stock can be developed. This article reports the first step in such a breeding programme, the production of a population of tetraploid lines for inter-breeding with diploids. Three methods of polyploid induction with colchicine were compared. A conversion rate of 8.9 per cent was obtained by applying 1.5 per cent colchicine to the shoot apical meristem of seedlings. A 7 per cent conversion rate was obtained by germination of scarified seed on filter paper saturated with 0.02 per cent colchicine for 16 h and this method is recommended on logistical and safety grounds. Poor results were obtained when scarified seed were submerged in aqueous solutions of colchicine. Flow cytometry is the preferred method for ploidy determination, sampling after vegetative phase change on a minimum of two opposing phyllodes per plant. Visual classification was inaccurate due to the confounding effects of growth-retarding properties of colchicine. Size and distribution of stomata can also be used but is more time consuming than flow cytometry. At 26 months, tetraploid plants had heavier, thicker, wider and more cupped shaped phyllodes than diploids and the bark: stem diameter ratio was greater.},

Most non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods provide indications of the qualities of the outer wood which often is the highest quality within the stem due to its typical higher stiffness and density and straighter grain; however this zone of wood is often removed during processing. Therefore transverse cores provide the most accurate, and greater breadth, of information for the full diameter. 
An improved tree corer system was developed during the early stages of this project, resulting in a patent for the coring bit. Using this tool, 1,130 transverse cores were extracted to provide information on the variation across the southern pine resources of sub-tropical Australia. These forest resources are classified as ‘stiffness-limited’ meaning that the grade quality and value is primarily determined by a sawn board’s stiffness. This report describes the variation at the plot level in mean wood stiffness (Modulus of Elasticity, MOE) detected through measurements on 986 of the transverse cores extracted and tested. 
Transverse cores’ stiffness data for four taxa are presented in this report: slash pine, Caribbean pine, the F1 hybrid and the F2 hybrid. The plots were classified and grouped for comparative analysis as thinning-age or clear-fell age. A regularisation method was performed for each 2 cm segment to calculate  a weighted average cambial age for each segment. This approach account for the relative proportions that each growth ring contributed to the segment’s cambial age.. The weighted average cambial age was then used to fit a five parameter logistic (5PL) function with MOE to provide fingerprint (?) of each plot.   Both thinning-age and clear-fell age plot means indicate relatively consistent wood stiffness within taxa. The exception was F2 hybrid growing on higher altitude sites in northern New South Wales. In this case, the cores from both plots in this region indicate low stiffness wood.},

   abstract = {The RetroSTEM model was developed for predicting three-dimensional stem and wood quality characteristics in conifer stems from simple measurements at felling. The model has been previously parameterised and tested for Scots pine. This study adapts the model to Norway spruce and evaluates its prediction power regarding stem and wood quality simulations from tree base to tree top, with the objective of identifying any systematic errors in the estimation. This information will be used for future model development. The selected quality factors – stem taper, branch size, ring width and wood density distributions – are critical for visual and strength-based timber grading and for timber yield estimations. The wood density simulations provided through visual tool, TreeViz, were embedded in the RetroSTEM. The model testing indicated that the height growth model embedded in RetroSTEM should be revised regarding growth at early ages. The predicted early height growth was too fast, which led to bias in the number of annual rings at the middle and lower parts of the stem and in stem diameter at the middle stem. However, the average bias in stem diameter was relatively small (−0.3 cm) at tree level. Similarly the average bias of branch maximum diameters was low (0.2 cm) at tree level, but RetroSTEM underestimated branch diameters in trees with long crowns. Overestimation in the number of annual rings also led to underestimation of average ring width. The TreeViz estimates of wood density seem realistic. At this stage the model is applicable to estimating stem quality distributions at stand level, particularly in dense stands younger than 100 years of age.},

   abstract = {A process-based growth model, PipeQual was adapted to Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) for describing stand development and timber properties (stem taper, heartwood formation and branchiness). PipeQual predictions on timber properties were tested against (1) the data set used for estimating the structural and metabolic parameters of the growth model, and (2) an independent data set. Both data sets consist of two stands located in southern and central Finland. Parameter values of the PipeQual model related to tree structure were estimated on the basis of measurements of tree characteristics. The metabolic parameters of the model were calibrated on the basis of stand-level predictions of basal area, dominant height, and stem volume. In addition, statistical models for branch characteristics were incorporated in the model. The predictions of stem taper, heartwood content and branchiness were consistent with measurements. However, the model slightly overestimated stem taper curve in the upper half of the stem in thinned stands. In addition, branch diameters were underestimated in the upper half of the stem in thinned and untreated stands, while branch diameters in the lower stem were somewhat overestimated. Overall, the results suggest that the PipeQual model has potential for simulating growth and properties of a Norway spruce stand.},

   abstract = {Research on ploidy identification and characterization of Acacia manguium tetraploids in comparison with diploid clones introduced from Australia and selected diploids from Vietnam have been conducted in laboratory and field trials at Ba Vi (Ha Noi), DongHa (Quang Tri) and Bau Bang (Binh Duong). The specific characteristics of diploid and tetraploid clones as ploidy index, stomatal cell's relative pollen lump have been identified. The most of in vitro propagated clones derived from colchicine treated Acacia Manguium have been identified as tetraploids (4n), but some clones are diploid (2n). The ploidy identification by Flow Cytometry showed that the polyploid index of 4n forms is more than 180 while ploidy index of 2n is varied between 75 and 95. The stomatal cell's relative area of 4n is varied over the range 14,413 to 14,421 while of 2n is 8,480 to 9,030 units. The relative pollen lump volume of 4n is varied from 55,726 to 65,804 while of 2n is 30,730 to 32,764 units. The clones with exactly identified ploidy levels are that ones that have identified chromosome numbers or possessed all characteristics as ploidy index, stomatal cell's relative area and relative pollen lump volume, specially characterized for each ploidy level as above-mentioned. The stem volume of 4 years-old tetraploid Acacia manguium trees is varied from 7.03 to 67.22 dm3/tree, while of respective diploids is 20.2 to 99.99 dm3/ tree. Wood fiber length in stems and branches of 4n (644.5-695.4µ m) is not significantly different with that of 2n (600.8-626.6 µ m), while wood fiber diameters of 4n and 2n are signficantly different , 16.91-19.52 and 13.80-15.96 µ m respectively. The selected tetraploid clones will be used for triploid heterotic breeding program.},

   volume = {119},
   abstract = {Research on ploidy identification and characterization of Acacia manguium tetraploids in comparison with diploid clones introduced from Australia and selected diploids from Vietnam have been conducted in laboratory and field trials at Ba Vi (Ha Noi), DongHa (Quang Tri) and Bau Bang (Binh Duong). The specific characteristics of diploid and tetraploid clones as ploidy index, stomatal cell's relative pollen lump have been identified. The most of in vitro propagated clones derived from colchicine treated Acacia Manguium have been identified as tetraploids (4n), but some clones are diploid (2n). The ploidy identification by Flow Cytometry showed that the polyploid index of 4n forms is more than 180 while ploidy index of 2n is varied between 75 and 95. The stomatal cell's relative area of 4n is varied over the range 14,413 to 14,421 while of 2n is 8,480 to 9,030 units. The relative pollen lump volume of 4n is varied from 55,726 to 65,804 while of 2n is 30,730 to 32,764 units. The clones with exactly identified ploidy levels are that ones that have identified chromosome numbers or possessed all characteristics as ploidy index, stomatal cell's relative area and relative pollen lump volume, specially characterized for each ploidy level as above-mentioned. The stem volume of 4 years-old tetraploid Acacia manguium trees is varied from 7.03 to 67.22 dm3/tree, while of respective diploids is 20.2 to 99.99 dm3/ tree. Wood fiber length in stems and branches of 4n (644.5-695.4µ m) is not significantly different with that of 2n (600.8-626.6 µ m), while wood fiber diameters of 4n and 2n are signficantly different , 16.91-19.52 and 13.80-15.96 µ m respectively. The selected tetraploid clones will be used for triploid heterotic breeding program.},

   abstract = {What caused the "Global Financial Crisis" (GFC) that erupted in mid-2007? What will be the consequences of the actions undertaken by governments to combat it? The more things change, the more they stay the same: the GFC is merely the latest in a long series of economic and financial crises that have punctuated the history of the past 250 or so years. Like its predecessors, three of which (namely the Panic of 1907, Depression of 1920-1921 and Great Depression of 1929-1946) this book analyses in detail, poor policies - in particular, the existence of legal tender laws, fractional reserve banking and central banking - are the GFC's ultimate causes. The logic and evidence is inescapable: in no financial and economic crisis have the same non-monetary phenomena been present; and in no crisis have these monetary phenomena been absent. Scientists, it seems, stand on the shoulders of giants; today's bankers, mainstream economists and politicians, on the other hand, continuously repeat the errors of their pygmy forebears. The intervention of government - and not the free market - causes the financial crises in Wall Street that become economic crises in Main Street. Indeed, the GFC's eruption demonstrates that "capitalism" (a term of abuse coined by Karl Marx to smear his opponents) hasn't failed; socialism has. It wasn't extreme capitalism (a term of abuse coined by ex-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to smear his opponents) that caused the panic and bust: it was the partial, corrupted and bastardised capitalism of the "mixed economy" that he and the mainstream champion. Accordingly, the eradication of crises necessitates the repeal of pernicious laws (such as legal tender) and the aboliton of damaging practices (namely fractional reserve and central banking).},

Despite the continuous upgrading of the strategic importance of knowledge and technology, human resource management paid little attention to the distinctive characteristics of those highly educated knowledge workers, especially in an international perspective. Based on a large-scale survey of multinational enterprises' (MNEs') decentralized R&D laboratories in Greece, this paper offers insights on the perceived impact of intrinsic and extrinsic compensation on performance. Focused on three distinctive types of research implemented by MNEs, results record the existence of a multifaceted context of researchers' needs and satisfaction determinants, which is differentiated among the different roles of R&D laboratories. Our findings witness that in an EU peripheral economy, R&D professionals are motivated by extrinsic rewards and mainly by economic compensation.},

   abstract = {Models were developed for predicting the proportion of latewood, wood density, tracheid length, tracheid width, and the ratio of cell wall thickness to tracheid width in individual annual rings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The models needed to be applicable as a part of a stand growth simulation system, which is based on growth models at the tree level. Data were collected from long-term thinning, thinning-fertilisation, and precommercial thinning experiments on mineral soil and drained peatland in southern and central Finland. The wood and tracheid properties were related to radial increment rate and distance from the pith outwards. An increased increment rate, caused by the different treatments and environmental conditions, resulted in similar types of changes in the wood and tracheid properties irrespective of the factors promoting radial increment. Although most of the average values of the properties were predicted unbiased, there were large random variations between individual trees and annual rings. The fixed parts of the models accounted for the following percentages of the variation: latewood proportion, 42%, wood density, 35%, tracheid length, 84%, tracheid width, 44%, and cell wall percentage, 29%. Incorporating the models for wood and tracheid properties into forest management planning systems enables estimates for the conversion of different silvicultural regimes into internal stem structure and wood quality.},

   title = {Regional calibration models for predicting loblolly pine tracheid properties using near-infrared spectroscopy},
   journal = {Wood Science and Technology},
   abstract = {This study developed regional calibration models for the prediction of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) tracheid properties using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. A total of 1842 pith-to-bark radial strips, aged 19–31 years, were acquired from 268 trees from 109 stands across the southeastern USA. Diffuse reflectance NIR spectra were collected at 10-mm increments from the radial face of pith-to-bark strips using a FOSS 5000 scanning spectrometer. A subset of the 10-mm samples was selected based on the NIR spectra uniqueness and placed in calibration (N = 1020) and validation (N = 998) test sets. The samples were macerated and the tracheid properties measured using an optical analyzer (Techpap MorFi Fiber and Shive Analyzer). Models were created using partial least squares (PLS) regression using the calibration samples, and their performance checked using the validation set. Prediction PLS models for tracheid length were strong when checked with the validation set [R p 2  = 0.87, standard error of prediction (SEP) = 0.23 mm, ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 2.8]. Prediction models for tracheid width had moderate fit statistics (R2 = 0.61, SEP = 1.6 μm, RPD = 1.6), but the SEP was similar to the measurement error of the camera (± 2 μm). The NIR wavelengths of importance were largely attributed to cellulose. The 1542 nm wavelength explained 77% of the variation in tracheid length (RMSE = 0.31 mm). These results demonstrate that NIR spectroscopy models for tracheid length and width can be developed from a diverse set of samples and still maintain prediction accuracy.},

   abstract = {Research on ploidy identification and characterization of Acacia manguium tetraploids in comparison with diploid clones introduced from Australia and selected diploids from Vietnam have been conducted in laboratory and field trials at Ba Vi (Ha Noi), DongHa (Quang Tri) and Bau Bang (Binh Duong). The specific characteristics of diploid and tetraploid clones as ploidy index, stomatal cell's relative pollen lump have been identified. The most of in vitro propagated clones derived from colchicine treated Acacia Manguium have been identified as tetraploids (4n), but some clones are diploid (2n). The ploidy identification by Flow Cytometry showed that the polyploid index of 4n forms is more than 180 while ploidy index of 2n is varied between 75 and 95. The stomatal cell's relative area of 4n is varied over the range 14,413 to 14,421 while of 2n is 8,480 to 9,030 units. The relative pollen lump volume of 4n is varied from 55,726 to 65,804 while of 2n is 30,730 to 32,764 units. The clones with exactly identified ploidy levels are that ones that have identified chromosome numbers or possessed all characteristics as ploidy index, stomatal cell's relative area and relative pollen lump volume, specially characterized for each ploidy level as above-mentioned. The stem volume of 4 years-old tetraploid Acacia manguium trees is varied from 7.03 to 67.22 dm3/tree, while of respective diploids is 20.2 to 99.99 dm3/ tree. Wood fiber length in stems and branches of 4n (644.5-695.4µ m) is not significantly different with that of 2n (600.8-626.6 µ m), while wood fiber diameters of 4n and 2n are signficantly different , 16.91-19.52 and 13.80-15.96 µ m respectively. The selected tetraploid clones will be used for triploid heterotic breeding program.},

   abstract = {* •Genomic selection (GS) is expected to cause a paradigm shift in tree breeding by improving its speed and efficiency. By fitting all the genome-wide markers concurrently, GS can capture most of the ‘missing heritability’ of complex traits that quantitative trait locus (QTL) and association mapping classically fail to explain. Experimental support of GS is now required. * •The effectiveness of GS was assessed in two unrelated Eucalyptus breeding populations with contrasting effective population sizes (Ne = 11 and 51) genotyped with > 3000 DArT markers. Prediction models were developed for tree circumference and height growth, wood specific gravity and pulp yield using random regression best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP). * •Accuracies of GS varied between 0.55 and 0.88, matching the accuracies achieved by conventional phenotypic selection. Substantial proportions (74–97%) of trait heritability were captured by fitting all genome-wide markers simultaneously. Genomic regions explaining trait variation largely coincided between populations, although GS models predicted poorly across populations, likely as a result of variable patterns of linkage disequilibrium, inconsistent allelic effects and genotype × environment interaction. * •GS brings a new perspective to the understanding of quantitative trait variation in forest trees and provides a revolutionary tool for applied tree improvement. Nevertheless population-specific predictive models will likely drive the initial applications of GS in forest tree breeding.},

   journal = {Diversity and Distributions},
   volume = {17},
   number = {5},
   pages = {771-787},
   abstract = {Aim  Australian acacias (1012 recognized species native to Australia, which were previously grouped in Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) have been moved extensively around the world by humans over the past 250 years. This has created the opportunity to explore how evolutionary, ecological, historical and sociological factors interact to affect the distribution, usage, invasiveness and perceptions of a globally important group of plants. This editorial provides the background for the 20 papers in this special issue of Diversity and Distributions that focusses on the global cross-disciplinary experiment of introduced Australian acacias. Location  Australia and global. Methods  The papers of the special issue are discussed in the context of a unified framework for biological invasions. Distributions of species were mapped across Australia, their representation in bioclimatic zones examined and the potential global distribution of the group modelled. By collating a variety of different lists, we determined which Australian acacias have reached different stages in the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum in different parts of the world. Paradigms and key research questions relating to barriers to invasion, stages of invasion and management perceptions are sketched. Results  According to our global database of Australian acacia records, 386 species have been moved outside Australia by human agency, 71 species are naturalized or weedy, and 23 are unequivocally invasive. Climatic models suggest that about a third of the world’s land surface is climatically suitable for Australian acacias. Many species are commercially important crops or are useful for other purposes and have been extensively planted, and many different human perceptions of Australian acacias exist in different parts of the world. The papers in the special issue cover all the barriers, stages and processes that define biological invasions and touch on many aspects: history and the human dimension; aspects of the species pool; species traits; biotic interactions; climate and niche; and management. Main conclusions  Australian acacias are an excellent model group for examining interactions between evolutionary, ecological and socio-economic drivers of species introductions. New insights have emerged on the biological, ecological and evolutionary correlates of naturalization and invasion, but human usage factors permeate all explanatory models. Understanding and managing introduced Australian acacias requires a fundamental and integrative appreciation of both intrinsic (e.g. species traits) and extrinsic (e.g. human usage and perceptions) aspects.},

   abstract = {1. A warming climate has been linked to shifts in plant distribution and growth. The relationship between climate and growth is used to infer past climate conditions within dendrochronological studies. However, browsing may interact with climate to determine growth, yet the impact of large herbivores on tree-ring growth series is largely unknown. 2. Here, we disentangle the interactions between climate and herbivory in determining plant growth at the upper distribution limit of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). 3. Stem discs of 206 birch were sampled within an altitudinal tree line ecotone in southern Norway, after 9 years of experimental browsing at three sheep densities (unbrowsed, low and high with 0, 25 and 80 sheep km−2). Annual radial growth was measured using digital microscopy and related to summer temperatures, altitude and sheep density. 4. Radial growth was negatively related to altitude and related to summer temperature in a nonlinear fashion, increasing from low temperatures and saturating and decreasing at high temperatures. However, the variation between browsing treatments overrode the influence of interannual temperature in determining growth. Increasing sheep densities limited radial growth and interacted with both temperature and altitude. The temperature of peak radial growth increased at higher densities of sheep, and growth was less limited by altitude at low sheep density. 5. This demonstrates that browsing interacts with temperature to determine the growth of mountain birch at the upper distribution limit and that the variation in growth linked to sheep density was greater than that linked to the 50-year range of interannual temperatures. The ability of browsing to affect radial growth has important implications for the use of dendrochronology to infer past climatic conditions, where samples are taken from regions that have undergone past land-use change.},

   abstract = {Abstract: This review article introduces recent technical and scientific reports on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in the wood and paper industry, which have increased during the last decade. Many researchers have reported that the NIR technique is useful for detection of both chemical and physical properties of wood materials and has been widely used in cases where the characteristic cellular structure of the material is retained. With regard to application of NIR spectroscopy to pulp and paper, many publications have reported its potential as an on-line measurement technique during paper-making process control. NIR spectroscopy is considered fundamental in applied research on wood and paper. Utilization of NIR spectroscopy in the wood and paper industry should take into account its applicability and limitations as a nondestructive technique.},

However, based on more than 150 in-depth interviews and case research carried out with 18 multinational companies from three industry groups between 1996 and 2000, we have identified six fundamental dilemmas that make it difficult even for companies with carefully managed distributed R&D networks to exploit the full potential of global innovation. In addition to a root-problem analysis, we surveyed these companies about the drivers of R&D globalization, and how these drivers would affect their organizations over the next 10 years. Although some of the trends that emerged are industry specific with regard to technology development, we describe five common traits that are expected to shape R&D organization in the mid-term future.},

   abstract = {Summary The potential of 40 mm-thick, back-sawn boards of 15-year- old Eucalyptus globulus Labill, subsp. globulus to produce dried appearance products was assessed. Two samples of boards from plantation grown logs described in Washusen et al. (2000) representing (i) the cross-section through each log (Sample 1), and (ii) outer heartwood boards (Sample 2) were dried to 12% moisture content. Sample 1 was dried using sheltered air-drying followed by kiln-drying. Sample 2 was kiln-dried from green without preliminary air-drying. Dried recovery results were poor in both samples and extensive degrade substantially reduced the recovery of undried boards graded select and better that were reported by Washusen et al. (2000). The dried recovery of select grade and better represented reductions of 69% and 60% for Sample 1 and 2 respectively, and based on Sample 1 the final recovery was estimated to be less than 2% of the original log volume. Tension wood was identified as one of the causes of drying degrade in boards from the outer heartwood. The results suggest that the species has little prospect for the production of high-quality solid wood products from unpruned logs from plantations in the southern Murray-Darling Basin unless there can be significant improvement in drying performance.},

   abstract = {The relationship between variation in wood shrinkage and cellulose crystallite width determined by X-ray diffraction was
assessed using SilviScan-2 (a system developed at CSIRO for rapid assessment of wood microstructure). Cellulose crystallite
width, density and microfibril angle were determined for 600μm wide zones on small wood samples with known tangential
shrinkage. The tangential shrinkage measurements included shrinkage to 12% moisture content after reconditioning (MC
AR); and a shrinkage differential calculated from tangential shrinkage to 12% MC AR recorded for each zone; and the
minimum shrinkage recorded in adjacent wood of similar cambial age. Spearman correlations and forward stepwise
regressions showed that the cellulose crystallite width was a good predictor of the shrinkage measures and that density was a
minor predictor. Together, cellulose crystallite width and density could explain 75% of the variation in tangential shrinkage for
randomly selected locations throughout the tree, and 87% of the variation in tangential shrinkage in samples selected from the
lower 5% of tree height. The results suggest that SilviScan-2 can be used to predict tangential shrinkage during drying in
increment cores, and may therefore be useful in developing non-destructive sampling strategies in tree improvement programs
for E. globulus.},

   abstract = {Although density-specific stiffness, E/rho, (where E is Young's modulus and rho is wood density) is often assumed constant by the elastic similarity model, and in determination of critical buckling height (H(crit)), few studies have tested this assumption within species. Here this assumption is tested for Pinus radiata growing across an environmental gradient, and theory is combined with data to develop a model of Young's modulus.|Analyses use an extensive series of environmental plots covering the range of climatic and edaphic conditions over which P. radiata is grown in New Zealand. Reduced major axis regression was used to determine scaling exponents between log-log plots of H(crit) vs. groundline diameter (D), and E/rho vs. D. Path analysis was used to identify significant direct and indirect (through stem slenderness) edaphic and climatic influences on E.|Density-specific stiffness exhibited 3-fold variation. As E/rho scaled positively with D, the exponent of 0.95 between H(crit) and D exceeded the assumed value of 0.67 under constant E/rho. The final path analysis model included mean air temperature in early autumn (T(aut)) and slenderness as significant (P < 0.05) positive direct influences on E. Tree leaf area index and T(aut) were indirectly associated with E through their significant (P < 0.05) positive direct relationship with stem slenderness. Young's modulus was most sensitive to T(aut), followed by stem slenderness then leaf area index, and the final model explained 76 % of the variance in E.|The findings suggest that within species E/rho variation may influence H(crit) and the scaling exponent between D and H(crit) so important in assumptions regarding allometric relationships. The model presented may provide a useful means of determining variation in E, E/rho and H(crit) across environmental gradients.},

   journal = {Forest Ecology and Management},
   volume = {259},

   pages = {33-44},
   abstract = {More than 2.5 million ha of Eucalyptus globulus are now planted across the globe including approximately 500 000 ha in southern Australia. In this region average annual rainfall has declined since 1960 and this trend is predicted to continue in the coming decades. E. globulus is a premium species for paper manufacture and grows well under moderate seasonal water stress. The traits that underpin this rapid early growth also make the species vulnerable to prolonged water stress. We established nitrogen rate and nitrogen-by-stocking experiments in five 2-year-old E. globulus plantations along a climatic gradient in south-western Australia. We measured volume growth, predawn leaf water potential and leaf area index over 7 years or until the plantations were 9 years old. These data were used to explore the relationship between growth and water stress, to understand the mechanistic basis for the relationship and to identify best-bet management strategies for E. globulus plantations in southern Australia.

Nearly all of the variation in volume growth rate between sites could be explained by a combination of climate wetness index and soil depth. There was a significant growth response to nitrogen at two low rainfall and one high rainfall site. There was no growth response to nitrogen on sites where total soil nitrogen in the top 0.1 m of soil was more than 1.9 mg g−1 and a very rapid increase in relative growth response below this threshold. The observed growth response to nitrogen was associated with an increase in water stress and on at least one site increased mortality. Matching the supply of nutrients to demand will maximise the growth at any site but this may increase the risk of drought death at water-limited sites. This will be exacerbated if forecasted changes in the climate of southern Australia are realised. Thinning to 600 stems ha−1 significantly reduced the level of water stress experienced by E. globulus in Western Australia without significantly affecting end of rotation stand volume compared to unthinned stands. These results indicate that for a range of sites in south-western Australia a final stocking density of 600 stems ha−1 coupled with application of fertiliser to maximise growth will minimise risk without sacrificing any of the site potential},

   abstract = {This paper reports on variation in leaf area index (L) in five Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantations in response to application of nitrogen, thinning at age 2 years and variation in climate wetness index (the ratio of rainfall to potential evaporation). Observed L is compared with: (i) L predicted to optimize net primary productivity for a given average annual temperature, annual water use and potential evaporation (Lopt) and (ii) L calculated as a linear function of climate wetness index (Leq). L peaked in fertilized plots at between 4 and 5 years of age or immediately after canopy closure. The value of L from canopy closure to age 8 years was not strongly related to annual rainfall or climate wetness index. At two sites with total soil nitrogen <1.2 mg g−1, L in fertilized plots was about two units greater than in unfertilized plots. This difference persisted until measurements ended in 2004 when the trees were 8 years old. The L of plots thinned to 300 and 600 stems ha−1 at age 2 years recovered quickly and was not significantly different from L in unthinned plots when the trees were 8 years old. Lopt was a good predictor of the leaf area index of 8-year-old plots of E. globulus when nitrogen and phosphorus were non-limiting (model efficiency (EF) was 0.5). For the same plots, Leq underestimated observed L by an average of two units, and the model efficiency was low (−3.25). Data from two nitrogen-limited sites demonstrated that for fertilized plots Lopt (EF = 0.6) was a much better predictor of L than Leq (EF = −3.36). At the same sites, Leq (EF = 0.42) was a better model for predicting L of unfertilized plots than Lopt (−3.59). These results provide evidence that comparing observed L with Lopt can identify stands limited by factors other than growing climate.},

   abstract = {In 1990, a 2-ha plantation of Eucalyptus nitens (Deane and Maiden) Maiden was established in southeastern Tasmania and subjected to different irrigation regimes. Point dendrometers were installed in March 1995 to monitor radial stem movement every 15 min over several growing seasons. In this study, data from two growing seasons (1996-1998) were considered. From these measurements, daily increments of stem radius were determined. At the end of the second growing season, we extracted 12-mm cores and measured microfibril angles (MFA) of the wood at high resolution. Microfibril angles were rescaled on a time axis and mapped to daily and distance-based elements. Among treatments, irrigated trees in particular formed higher MFA early in the growing season (September-November) and lower MFA later in the growing season. Trees subjected to cyclic droughts showed clear relationships between MFA and soil water deficits, with MFA increasing in response to water stress release. Increases in MFA were preceded by accelerations in daily increment of stem radius. Among treatments, trees subjected to severe drought had the smallest MFA and generally low fluctuations in MFA. Irrigated trees were susceptible to changes in climate, whereas growth of the trees in the other treatments was limited by water availability. Use of path-analysis showed that temperature had an effect on stem radius increment but not on MFA; wind speed was the only factor that influenced MFA directly. Microfibril angle was correlated with stem shrinking and expansion phases; growth period length and growth rates were positively related to MFA.},

   abstract = {Projected temperature increases under global warming could benefit southern tree species by providing them the optimal growing temperature and could be detrimental to northern species by exposing them to the supra optimal growing temperatures. This benefit-detriment trade-off could increase the competitive advantage of southern species in the northern species range and cause the increase or even dominance of southern species in the northern domain. However, the optimum temperature for photosynthesis of C3 plants may increase due to CO2 enrichment. An increase in the optimum temperature could greatly reduce the benefit-detriment effect. In this study, we coupled a forest ecosystem process model (PnET-II) and a forest GAP model (LINKAGES) with a spatially dynamic forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) to study how an optimum temperature increase could affect forest landscape response due to global warming. We simulated 360 years of forest landscape change in the Boundary Water Canoe Area (BWCA) in northern Minnesota, which is transitional between boreal and temperate forest. Our results showed that, under the control scenario of continuing the historic 1984–1993 mean climate (mainly temperature, precipitation and CO2), the BWCA will become a spruce-fir dominated boreal forest. However, under the scenario of predicted climatic change [the 2000–2099 climates are predicted by Canadian Climate Center (CCC), followed by 200 years of continuing the predicted 2090–2099 mean climate], the BWCA will become a pine-dominated mixed forest. If the optimum temperature increases gradually with [CO2] (the increase in optimum temperature is assumed to change gradually from 0 °C in year 2000 to 5 °C in year 2099 when [CO2] reaches 711 ppm and stabilizes at 5 °C after year 2099), the BWCA would remain a fir-dominated boreal forest in areas with relatively high water-holding capacity, but not in areas with relatively low water-holding capacity. Our results suggest that the [CO2] induced increases in optimum temperature could substantially reduce forest landscape change caused by global warming. However, not all tree species would be able to successfully adapt to future warming as predicted by CCC, regardless of optimum temperature acclimations.},

   abstract = {Tree water deficit estimated by measuring water-related changes in stem radius (ΔW) was compared with tree water deficit estimated from the output of a simple, physiologically reasonable model (ΔWE), with soil water potential (Ψsoil) and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) as inputs. Values of ΔW were determined by monitoring stem radius changes with dendrometers and detrending the results for growth. We followed changes in ΔW and ΔWE in Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus pubescens Willd. over 2 years at a dry site (2001–2002; Salgesch, Wallis) and in Picea abies (L.) Karst. for 1 year at a wet site (1998; Davos, Graubuenden) in the Swiss Alps.The seasonal courses of ΔW in deciduous species and in conifers at the same site were similar and could be largely explained by variation in ΔWE. This finding strongly suggests that ΔW, despite the known species-specific differences in stomatal response to microclimate, is mainly explained by a combination of atmospheric and soil conditions. Consequently, we concluded that trees are unable to maintain any particular ΔW. Either Ψsoil or VPD alone provided poorer estimates of ΔW than a model incorporating both factors. As a first approximation of ΔWE, Ψsoil can be weighted so that the negative mean Ψsoil reaches 65 to 75% of the positive mean daytime VPD over a season (Q. pubescens: ∼65%, P. abies: ∼70%, P. sylvestris: ∼75%). The differences in ΔW among species can be partially explained by a different weighting of Ψsoil against VPD. The ΔW of P. sylvestris was more dependent on Ψsoil than that of Q. pubescens, but less than that of P. abies, and was less dependent on VPD than that of P. abies and Q. pubescens. The model worked well for P. abies at the wet site and for Q. pubescens and P. sylvestris at the dry site, and may be useful for estimating water deficit in other tree species.},
